# Sprint 1 User Stories

Sprint 1 scope is limited to the first vertical slice: demonstrating the core
flow from login through project creation, template definition, entry
capture, timeline, and basic statistics — not the whole Digital Logbook
feature set.

## Demo flow

1. User signs in.
2. Dashboard opens.
3. User creates a project.
4. User defines the project entry format.
5. User captures a logbook entry using that format.
6. User views the saved entry in the project timeline.
7. User sees basic project statistics update.
8. User logs out.

## US1. Sign in to the system

**Who:** As a registered user
**What:** I want to sign in using a secure authentication method
**Why:** So that I can access my own logbook data safely.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The user is on the login page and has a valid account | The user enters valid login details and submits the form | The system authenticates the user and redirects them to the dashboard |
| AT2 | The user is on the login page | The user enters invalid login details | The system shows a clear error message and does not open the dashboard |
| AT3 | The user is not authenticated | The user tries to open a protected page | The system redirects the user to the login page |

## US2. View dashboard after login

**Who:** As a signed-in user
**What:** I want to see a dashboard with my active projects and quick actions
**Why:** So that I can continue logging work without searching through the app.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The user has successfully signed in | The dashboard loads | The system displays the active projects area and a create-project action |
| AT2 | The user has no projects yet | The dashboard loads | The system shows an empty-state message and a create-project action |
| AT3 | The user has active projects | The dashboard loads | The system lists the active projects with basic summary information |

## US3. Create a project

**Who:** As a signed-in user
**What:** I want to create a project with a name and optional description
**Why:** So that I can start keeping logbook entries for a specific piece of work.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The user is on the dashboard | The user opens the create-project form | The system displays fields for project name and description |
| AT2 | The user enters a valid unique project name | The user saves the project | The project is created and appears in the active projects list |
| AT3 | The user leaves the project name empty | The user tries to save the project | The system rejects the form and explains that the project name is required |

## US4. Define the project entry format

**Who:** As a project owner
**What:** I want to define fields and field types for the project entry format
**Why:** So that entries in that project record the information that matters for that project.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | A project has been created | The owner opens the entry-format builder | The system allows field names and field types to be added |
| AT2 | The owner defines at least one valid field | The owner saves the format | The system stores the format as the active format for that project |
| AT3 | The owner tries to save no fields or duplicate field names | The owner submits the format | The system rejects the format and shows a clear validation message |

## US5. Capture a logbook entry quickly

**Who:** As a project owner
**What:** I want to create a logbook entry using the project's active format
**Why:** So that I can record what I just worked on before I forget.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The project has an active entry format | The owner opens quick entry for that project | The system displays only fields defined in that project's active format |
| AT2 | The quick-entry form is open | The owner enters valid values and saves the entry | The system stores the entry against the selected project and confirms it was saved |
| AT3 | The entry format contains predictable fields or built-in metadata | The quick-entry form opens | The system pre-fills date/time/project where possible while still allowing edits |

## US6. View project entries in a timeline

**Who:** As a project owner
**What:** I want to view saved entries in reverse chronological order
**Why:** So that I can see the history of work done on the project.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The project has one or more saved entries | The owner opens the project timeline | The system displays entries from newest to oldest |
| AT2 | An entry appears in the timeline | The owner scans the timeline | The system shows enough summary information to identify the entry |
| AT3 | The owner selects a specific project | The timeline is displayed | The system shows only entries belonging to that project |

## US7. View basic project statistics

**Who:** As a project owner
**What:** I want to see simple statistics calculated from the project entries
**Why:** So that I can understand how much work has been recorded for the project.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | A project has entries with duration values | The owner opens the project statistics view | The system displays the total time spent on that project |
| AT2 | New entries are added or edited | The statistics view is refreshed | The system updates the total time and entry count |
| AT3 | The owner opens the dashboard | There are multiple projects | The dashboard shows simple cross-project summaries such as total time per project |

## US8. Log out securely

**Who:** As a signed-in user
**What:** I want to log out of the system
**Why:** So that another person using the same device cannot access my logbook.

| Test | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AT1 | The user is signed in | The user selects log out | The system ends the session and redirects the user to the login page |
| AT2 | The user has logged out | The user tries to open the dashboard again | The system prevents access and asks the user to sign in again |
