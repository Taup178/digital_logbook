# Digital Logbook

**COMS3011A Project 7 — University of the Witwatersrand**

## What is this?

Digital Logbook is a web application that replaces a physical project logbook.
A user creates **projects**, defines the **shape of an entry** for each project
themselves (which fields it has, and what type each field is), and then quickly
captures entries against that format over time. The system then gives them a
timeline of their work and simple statistics calculated from those entries.

The core design challenge — and the reason this isn't a simple CRUD app — is
that **the owner decides the shape of their own data**. Everything else
(entry capture, timeline, statistics, search) has to work generically against
whatever fields a project owner has defined, rather than against a fixed,
predetermined schema.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Firebase Auth
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express, split into services (auth, dashboard, project)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase (accessed only through our own API — never directly from the frontend)
- **Version control:** Gitea (`sdp.ms.wits.ac.za`)
- **CI/CD:** Gitea Actions workflow definition, mirrored to GitHub for deployment
- **Hosting:** Render (backend services), Cloudflare Pages (this documentation site)

!!! note "Course requirement"
    Supabase is used only as a hosted Postgres database, accessed exclusively
    through our own hand-written Express API. The frontend never queries
    Supabase directly — this satisfies the brief's "hand-written API" requirement,
    which explicitly disallows auto-generated backend endpoints (e.g. querying
    Firestore or Supabase directly from the client).
