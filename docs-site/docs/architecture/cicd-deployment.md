# CI/CD & Deployment

## Why this mattered

The course brief requires CI/CD for both collaboration and deployment
(Section 2.1). This is a graded requirement, factoring into the Milestone 1
and Milestone 4 rubrics under Version Control, Git Methodology, and Deployment.

## Constraints we had to design around

- **Gitea Actions was not enabled** on the university's instance
  (`sdp.ms.wits.ac.za`). Enabling it would require university-side
  infrastructure (dedicated runners, Docker provisioning), which wasn't
  realistic to request for one project — so CI could not run natively inside Gitea.
- **The Gitea server is on a private network.** Cloud hosting platforms
  (Render, Vercel, Netlify) could not reach `sdp.ms.wits.ac.za` directly — any
  "connect your Git repo" flow on those platforms failed with an invalid
  repository error.

## Solution: Gitea → GitHub push mirror → Render

```
Local commit → Wits Gitea (source of truth) → Push Mirror → GitHub → Render (build & deploy)
```

- **Only one component needs to be publicly reachable:** GitHub. Gitea
  remains the actual working repository the whole team pushes to.
- **Push mirror, not pull mirror** — configured with "Sync when commits are
  pushed," so every push to Gitea is forwarded to GitHub automatically, with
  no manual syncing step.
- **Mirror interval set to 0** (periodic polling disabled) since the
  push-triggered sync already fires in real time.
- **Render is connected to the mirrored GitHub repo**, not Gitea, since
  that's the only route Render can actually reach.
- **Only one team member needs a GitHub account/PAT.** Everyone else only
  ever interacts with Gitea. Commit authorship (names, emails) is preserved
  through the mirror, so individual contribution is still attributable on GitHub.

## CI pipeline definition

Committed at `.gitea/workflows/ci.yml`, on Gitea itself (not just GitHub), so
CI evidence is visible in the same repository tutors will actually be marking:

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js Environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install & Test Frontend
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm test --if-present

      - name: Install & Test Auth Service
        run: |
          cd services/auth-service
          npm install
          npm test --if-present

      - name: Install & Test Dashboard Service
        run: |
          cd services/dashboard-service
          npm install
          npm test --if-present

      - name: Install & Test Project Service
        run: |
          cd services/project-service
          npm install
          npm test --if-present
```

### Why each part exists

| Part | Reason |
|---|---|
| `on: push` / `pull_request` | Runs both when code lands on `main` and when a PR targets it, catching broken code before merge, not just after |
| `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` | A clean, disposable VM per run, so results aren't polluted by any local machine's installed packages or state |
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Pulls a fresh copy of the repo onto the VM — without it there's no code to test |
| `actions/setup-node@v4`, `node-version: '20'` | Installs the JS runtime, pinned to the version the services are built for |
| Four separate install-and-test steps | One per service, since the repo is a monorepo of independently deployable services — testing them as one blob would hide which specific service broke |
| `npm test --if-present` | Prevents the pipeline from failing just because a service doesn't yet have a test script defined; it only fails on an actual failing test |

## Deploying with `render.yaml`

Instead of manually configuring each service through Render's dashboard, a
single `render.yaml` blueprint at the repo root provisions all three services
from one file:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: auth-service
    env: node
    plan: free
    rootDir: services/auth-service
    buildCommand: npm install
    startCommand: npm start
    envVars:
      - key: PORT
        value: 5001
      - key: SUPABASE_URL
        sync: false
      - key: SUPABASE_KEY
        sync: false
  # ...same pattern for dashboard-service (5002) and project-service (5003)
```

- **`plan: free`** is set explicitly — Render defaults new services to a paid
  instance type unless told otherwise, which triggered a payment prompt.
- **`sync: false`** on Supabase keys tells Render "enter this manually in the
  dashboard, don't try to sync it automatically" — so real secrets are never
  written into the committed YAML file.

## Problems hit during deployment (and fixes)

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Root directory 'services/project-service' does not exist` | An earlier push had accidentally created a nested duplicate folder (`project-service/project-service/...`) | Renamed/restructured the top-level folder cleanly under `services/`, rather than encoding the mistake into `rootDir` |
| `Missing script: "start"` | Each service's `package.json` had no `"start"` entry, which Render calls by default after building | Added `"scripts": { "start": "node index.js" }` |
| `Cannot find module '.../services/auth-service/index.js'` | Each service's real entry file lived at `src/index.js`, not at the folder root | Corrected `package.json`: `"main": "src/index.js"`, `"scripts": { "start": "node src/index.js" }` |

!!! note "Lesson learned"
    `render.yaml`'s `rootDir` only tells Render which folder to run commands
    in — it knows nothing about the internal file layout inside that folder.
    The `package.json` inside each service is what has to be accurate.
