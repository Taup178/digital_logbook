# AI Pair-Programming Transcript — Digital Logbook

**Date:** 14–16 August 2026  
**Project:** Codacaine Digital Logbook (React frontend + Node/Express microservices + Supabase)  
**Repository:** `https://github.com/Hlulani-B/Digital-Logbook.git` / Gitea mirror  

This document records the changes made with the help of the AI coding assistant during the session.

---

## 1. Repository Setup

- Cloned `main` from the Gitea origin. When direct authentication failed, the GitHub mirror was used to initialise the local workspace.
- Added `GITEA_TOKEN` to the root `.env` file and ensured `.gitignore` excluded `.env` files.
- Added the Gitea remote and configured GitHub/Gitea remotes for pull/push workflow.

## 2. Profile Service

### Created
- `services/profile-service/` matching the existing service pattern.
- `services/profile-service/package.json` — Node/Express service with ESM (`"type": "module"`), Jest test script and Babel dev dependencies.
- `services/profile-service/src/supabase.js` — Supabase client using `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY || SUPABASE_KEY`.
- `services/profile-service/src/config.js` — loads `.env` before any imports that need environment variables.
- `services/profile-service/src/index.js` — Express server mounting routes under `/service`.

### Backend functions — `services/profile-service/src/functions/`
- `login.js` — `Login.checkUser(email)` returns `true` if the user exists in the `users` table, otherwise `false`.
- `profile.js` — preserved the user's class structure:
  - `Username.username(email, username)` — rejects if username is taken, otherwise updates the user's username.
  - `Email.email(email)` — inserts a new user email.
  - `Name.name(email, new_name)` — updates the user's display name.
  - `Avatar.avatar(email, url)` — updates the user's avatar URL.
  - `Profile.getProfile(email)` — fetches a full profile.
  - `Profile.deleteProfile(email)` — cascades deletion across `entries`, `fields`, `projects`, and `users`.

### Routes — `services/profile-service/src/Routes/`
- `login.js` — `POST /service/login` with `function: "checkUser"`.
- `profile.js` — `POST /service/profile` with `function`: `"username"`, `"email"`, `"name"`, `"avatar"`, `"getProfile"`, `"deleteProfile"`.

### Tests — `services/profile-service/src/__tests__/`
- `login.test.js` — 3 tests for user-exists, user-not-found, and error cases.
- `profile.test.js` — 13 tests covering all profile classes and success/failure paths.
- `src/__mocks__/supabase.js` and `src/__mocks__/supabaseMock.js` — shared Supabase mock helpers.
- `babel.config.js` — Babel/Jest ESM transform configuration.

### Frontend — `frontend/src/functions/profile/`
- `login.js` — `checkUser(email)`.
- `profile.js` — `updateUsername`, `addEmail`, `updateName`, `updateAvatar`, `getProfile`, `deleteProfile`.

### Result
All profile-service tests pass:

## 3. Project Service Improvements

### ESM conversion
- Converted `services/project-service` from CommonJS to ESM (`"type": "module"`).
- Added `src/config.js` so `.env` loads before Supabase imports.
- Rewrote `src/index.js` with ESM imports and mounted all routes under `/service`.
- Updated `babel.config.js` for ESM Jest tests.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed `project.js` to import `{ supabase }` from `../supabase.js` (was using undefined `supabase_client`).
- Fixed `entries.js` and `priority.js` Supabase imports from default to named imports.
- Fixed `priority.js` logic that confused the method parameter with a constant.

### Cascade on project changes
- `deleteProject` now deletes related rows from `entries`, then `fields`, then `projects`.
- `editProjectName` now updates `project_name` in `entries` and `table_name` in `fields` before renaming the project.

### Archive feature end-to-end
- Implemented `services/project-service/src/functions/archives.js`:
  - `archive_project` / `unarchive_project` — sets `is_archived` on `projects`.
  - `archive_entry` / `unarchive_entry` — sets `archived` on `entries`.
- Created `services/project-service/src/Routes/archive.js` — `POST /service/archive`.
- Created `frontend/src/functions/project/archives.js` for the React frontend.
- Updated `docs-site/docs/architecture/database.md` to document the archive columns.
- Added `services/project-service/src/__tests__/archives.test.js`.

### Field feature
- Created `services/project-service/src/Routes/field.js` and connected it in `index.js`.
- Created `frontend/src/functions/project/fields.js` (user's frontend update).

### Tests
- `services/project-service` tests cover `project.js`, `entries.js`, `priority.js`, and `archives.js`.

## 4. Database Schema Documentation

Updated `docs-site/docs/architecture/database.md` to match the live Supabase schema shown in the screenshot:

- `projects` now documents both `is_archived` (canonical project archive flag) and `archived` columns.
- `entries` documents the `archived` column.
- Added `idx_projects_is_archived` index and updated SQL `ALTER TABLE` statements.
- Added rationale explaining why `is_archived` is used for projects and `archived` for entries.

---

## 5. Render & CI Configuration

- Updated `render.yaml` to include the new `profile-service` and `.env` variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `PORT`) for all services with `sync: false` for secrets.
- Updated `.gitea/workflows/ci.yml` to include the profile-service build/test step.
- Added local `.env` files under each service directory for local development.

---

## 6. Sync & Push

- Fetched latest `main` from GitHub and Gitea.
- Merged remote changes where needed.
- Pushed commits to both GitHub and Gitea `main` so both mirrors stay in sync.

---

## Commands Verified During the Session

```bash
# Profile service tests
cd services/profile-service
npm test

# Project service tests
cd services/project-service
npm test

# Start profile service locally
cd services/profile-service
npm start

# curl health check
curl http://localhost:5004/

# curl login route
curl -X POST http://localhost:5004/service/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"function":"checkUser","values":{"email":"test@example.com"}}'
```

---

## Notes

- The frontend profile-service URL is currently set to `https://profile-service.onrender.com`. Update it to the actual Render deployment URL once the service is deployed.
- An uncommitted `getAllEntries` method in `services/project-service/src/functions/entries.js` was preserved and included in the commit.

## 7. UI Theme Overhaul — White/Professional + Dark/Light Toggle (16 August 2026)

### Initial request: make UI white and professional
The original UI used a dark glass-morphism theme (`#0a0a0f` background, translucent cards, neon accents). The user requested a clean, white, professional look.

**Changes made (commit `d6c2b4d`):**
- Replaced `:root` CSS variables: dark backgrounds → `#f8f9fb`, light text → `#1f2937`, etc.
- Removed glass morphism (`backdrop-filter`) from cards; replaced with white `#ffffff` surfaces and subtle box shadows.
- Updated navbar to white translucent background (`rgba(255,255,255,0.92)`).
- Updated dropdown, settings panel, and form inputs to white backgrounds.
- Changed stat icons, buttons, badges, and toggle switches to light-theme-appropriate colors.
- Switched all CAPTCHA widgets from `theme: "dark"` to `theme: "light"`.
- Updated all inline dark-mode colors (error/success text, danger zone, password strength bars) to readable light-theme equivalents.

**Files changed:** `index.css`, `SignIn.tsx`, `ResetPassword.tsx`, `UpdatePassword.tsx`, `SettingsPanel.tsx`

### Follow-up request: add dark/light theme toggle
The user then wanted both themes available as a user-selectable option.

**Changes made (commit `eb08267`):**
- Created `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` — a React hook that:
  - Reads saved theme from `localStorage` (key: `dl_theme`)
  - Defaults to `"light"` if no saved preference
  - Applies/removes `data-theme="dark"` attribute on `<html>`
  - Provides `theme`, `setTheme`, and `toggleTheme` methods
- Added `[data-theme="dark"]` CSS block in `index.css` with full dark theme variable overrides and component-specific dark styles (glass morphism restored, gradient text, dark orbs, etc.).
- Replaced all remaining hard-coded color values in CSS rules with CSS custom properties (`--surface-solid`, `--navbar-bg`, `--toggle-track`, `--error-text`, `--danger-text`, etc.) so dark theme can override them.
- Added `ThemeInitializer` wrapper in `App.tsx` to apply saved theme on app load.
- Added **Theme selector** dropdown (Light / Dark) in **Settings > Preferences > Display**.
- Made CAPTCHA widgets dynamic — they switch between `"light"` and `"dark"` Turnstile themes based on active theme.
- Made all inline colors in TSX files theme-aware (ternary on `theme === "dark"` for error/success text, password strength bars, saved indicator).

**Files changed:** `hooks/useTheme.ts` (new), `index.css`, `App.tsx`, `SettingsPanel.tsx`, `SignIn.tsx`, `ResetPassword.tsx`, `UpdatePassword.tsx`

### How the theme system works
1. Default theme is **Light** (white).
2. User goes to **Settings > Preferences > Theme** to switch.
3. Selection is saved to `localStorage` and applied instantly via `data-theme` attribute.
4. Theme persists across sessions.
5. All components (cards, navbar, dropdowns, panels, forms, CAPTCHAs, buttons) adapt automatically.
