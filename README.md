# Codacaine - Digital Logbook

A microservices-based digital logbook app built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend services), using Supabase for auth and database.

## Architecture

This is a monorepo containing independent backend services and a React frontend. Each service runs as its own process on its own port.

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS) and npm
- A Supabase project (URL + API key)
- Git

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```powershell
git clone https://sdp.ms.wits.ac.za/codacaine/Digital-Logbook.git
cd Digital-Logbook
```

### 2. Install dependencies for each service

```powershell
cd services\auth-service
npm install
cd ..\dashboard-service
npm install
cd ..\project-service
npm install
cd ..\..
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

## Environment Variables

Each backend service needs its own `.env` file in its root folder. These are not pushed to Gitea (listed in `.gitignore`) since they contain secret keys, so every teammate must create their own locally.

Create a `.env` file inside each service folder:

- `services/auth-service/.env`
- `services/dashboard-service/.env`
- `services/project-service/.env`

Each file should contain:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://yourproject.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
PORT=4001
```

Use the same `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` across all three services (shared database), but give each service a different `PORT`:

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| auth-service | 4001 |
| dashboard-service | 4002 |
| project-service | 4003 |

Get the Supabase URL and key from the team lead or Supabase project settings — do not commit these values to the repo.

## Running the Project

Run each service in its own terminal:

```powershell
cd services\auth-service
node index.js
```

```powershell
cd services\dashboard-service
node index.js
```

```powershell
cd services\project-service
node index.js
```

Run the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

# Digital Logbook — Frontend

A modern, premium frontend for the **Digital Logbook** application built as part of the **COMS3011A Project 7** (University of the Witwatersrand). This frontend handles user authentication, profile management, and dashboard functionality using React, Supabase, and Cloudflare Turnstile.

---

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **React 19 + TypeScript** | UI framework with type safety |
| **Vite 6** | Build tool and dev server |
| **React Router v7** | Client-side routing |
| **Supabase** | Authentication (Google & GitHub OAuth) |
| **Cloudflare Turnstile** | CAPTCHA bot protection |
| **CSS (custom)** | Premium glassmorphism UI (no Tailwind dependency) |

---

## Features

### 1. Sign-In Page (`/signin`)

**What it does:** Provides a clean, secure entry point for users to authenticate using their Google or GitHub accounts.

**Why:** The project specification requires users to sign up and sign in using established authentication libraries. OAuth eliminates the need for users to remember passwords and leverages trusted identity providers.

**Key details:**
- **Google OAuth** — one-click sign-in/sign-up via Google accounts
- **GitHub OAuth** — alternative provider for developer-friendly authentication
- **Email / Password** — traditional sign-in and sign-up with CAPTCHA-gated form; supports the password reset flow end-to-end
- **Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA** — invisible bot protection that must be verified before any sign-in button becomes active
- **"Forgot password?" link** — accessible entry point to the password reset flow
- Animated gradient background with glassmorphism card design
- OAuth accounts are created automatically on first sign-in (no separate sign-up step)

### 2. OAuth Callback Handler (`/auth/callback`)

**What it does:** Handles the redirect from Google/GitHub after authentication, exchanges the authorization code for a Supabase session, and redirects the user to the dashboard.

**Why:** OAuth flows require a callback URL to complete authentication. This handler ensures a seamless transition from the identity provider back to the application.

### 3. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

**What it does:** The main authenticated landing page showing a personalized greeting, stats overview, and quick actions.

**Why:** Provides users with an immediate overview of their logbook activity and fast access to common actions.

**Key details:**
- **Smart greeting** — displays "Welcome" for first-time users and "Welcome back" for returning users, tracked per-user in `localStorage`
- **Stats cards** — Total Entries, This Week, and Projects with animated entrance and hover effects
- **Quick actions** — New Entry, View All Entries, Export Data buttons
- **Gradient text** on the greeting heading for visual impact

### 4. Profile Menu (Avatar Dropdown)

**What it does:** Clicking the user's avatar/name in the navbar opens a dropdown menu with quick access to profile management, settings, and sign-out.

**Why:** Keeps the navbar clean while providing instant access to account management without navigating away from the current page.

**Key details:**
- Shows user's name and email at the top
- **Manage Profile** — opens the Profile tab in the settings panel
- **Settings** — opens the Preferences tab
- **Sign Out** — securely ends the session
- Closes on outside click or Escape key

### 5. Settings Panel (Slide-Out)

**What it does:** A full-featured slide-out panel from the right side of the screen with three tabs for managing the user's account and preferences.

**Why:** Allows users to personalise their logbook experience without leaving the dashboard, making the app easier to use over time.

#### Profile Tab
- **Preferred Name** — customise how the app greets you (overrides the Google/GitHub name on the dashboard)
- **Role** — Student, Lecturer, Tutor, or Professional
- **Student Number** — for Wits student identification
- **Bio / Notes** — private notes visible only to the user

#### Preferences Tab
- **Default View** — choose where you land after sign-in (Dashboard, Entries, Projects, Calendar)
- **Week Starts On** — Monday, Sunday, or Saturday
- **Time Format** — 24-hour or 12-hour clock
- **Auto-save entries** — toggle automatic draft saving
- **Compact mode** — tighter layout to see more data at once
- **Email notifications** — toggle account update emails
- **Weekly log reminder** — toggle Friday nudges to log hours

#### Account Tab
- **Account information** — email, sign-in method (Google/GitHub/email), and user ID
- **Password reset** — send a reset link to your email (sets up email-based auth alongside OAuth)
- **Danger Zone** — permanently delete account with confirmation dialog

### 6. Reset Password Flow (`/reset-password`)

**What it does:** Allows users to request a password reset link via email, protected by CAPTCHA.

**Why:** The project specification requires password reset functionality. This serves users who need email-based authentication alongside their OAuth provider.

**Key details:**
- Accessible from the sign-in page ("Trouble signing in?") and the Settings panel Account tab
- CAPTCHA-protected to prevent abuse
- Reset link expires in 1 hour
- Success confirmation shows which email received the link

### 7. Update Password (`/auth/update-password`)

**What it does:** After clicking a reset link, users set a new password with real-time feedback.

**Why:** Provides a secure, user-friendly password update experience with visual guidance.

**Key details:**
- **Password strength meter** — 4-bar indicator (Weak → Fair → Good → Strong) with colour coding
- **Live validation** — real-time "Passwords do not match" / "Passwords match" indicators
- Submit button disables until passwords match and meet minimum length
- Redirects to dashboard on success

### 8. Protected Routes

**What it does:** Ensures only authenticated users can access the dashboard. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the sign-in page.

**Why:** Prevents unauthorised access to protected resources.

### 9. Delete Account

**What it does:** Permanently deletes the user's account and all associated data via a Supabase RPC function.

**Why:** The project specification requires account deletion capability. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

## UI Design Philosophy

- **Glassmorphism** — frosted-glass cards with backdrop blur on a deep dark background
- **Animated gradient orbs** — floating background elements for visual depth
- **Staggered animations** — content enters with sequential fade-in-up transitions
- **Gradient accents** — indigo-to-purple gradients on the logo, buttons, and greeting text
- **Responsive** — works on mobile (full-width panels) and desktop
- **Custom favicon** — SVG-based "DL" badge matching the brand colour

---

## Branching Rules

- `main` and `services` branches are protected — no direct pushes, changes must go through a pull request with required approvals.
- Create a feature branch for your work:

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "describe your change"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request on Gitea into `main` (or `services` for backend-only work).

## Rule: Dashboard vs Project Data








## Architecture Boundary

**Frontend is presentation-only.** It renders UI and calls the Express API. It never:
- Imports `@supabase/supabase-js` or any database client
- Holds database credentials or Supabase keys
- Contains business logic (validation, data shaping, access rules)

**Backend owns all data access.** If the frontend needs new data or a new
capability, the fix is always in `backend/`:
- Missing endpoint → add a new route + service function in Express
- Wrong response shape → change the service function, not the frontend
- New feature needing data → build it as a backend service first, then
  call it from the frontend like everything else

If you're editing frontend code and find yourself reaching for a database
client, a `.env` credential, or writing a query — stop, that logic belongs
in `backend/functions/`.


## Before Pushing to `main`

1. `git pull origin main` — get the latest changes
2. Run the app locally and confirm it builds/runs without errors
3. Only then push

Never push straight to `main` without pulling and testing first.

- Project entries and their statistics stay scoped to that project (`project-service`).
- The dashboard (`dashboard-service`) only shows cross-project summaries — it does not read individual entry tables directly.
